# About my team's strategy

At our disposal, we had defense and offense components to place on the board. The defense are static and have the ability to destroy the opponent's attacking pieces, and the latter move in zigzag to reach the other side of the board. If they reach their goal, the HP of the opponent goes down.
Depending on the boss, the components are set differently on the board, with a more defensive or offensive strategy.
